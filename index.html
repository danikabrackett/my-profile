				<h1>Hi there, </h1>
				<h1> I'm Danika Brackett.👋🏼</h1>
				<img src="images/d3.jpg" class="img-circle" alt='Danika before eating her favourite meal of the day'>
				<p> I'm an American from Virginia living my best life in the magical city of London (I know, the word "magical" makes me want to gag too, but I mean, have you been here before? 😍). When I'm not nerding out about my MSc in Strategic Marketing from Imperial, I'm practising yoga, learning to code (I love it so very much now), reading books, eating drool-worthy food and spending time with good-hearted, light-spreading human beans. Basically, I'm prioritising the happy things.🌞</p>

				<h2>Travel 🌎</h2>
				<p> It's been a wild couple of years shirking adult responsibilities and abandoning pre-laid plans. I've been lucky to wander all over and have so much to share from what I've seen.
				<ul class="list-inline">
					<li>The Americas</li>
					<li>The UK and Europe</li>
					<li>Southeast Asia</li>
					<li>Plus everything else left on my travel list that I'm waiting to discover ✨</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Lifestyle 🍷</h2>
				<p> A space to appreciate the things that fill my time - books, wine, activities with friends. I can't promise much, but I can promise these are the things that make me genuinely happy, and may make you happy too.</p>

				<h2>Wellness 🌿</h2>
				<p> I'm no health goddess by any stretch of the imagination (I'll leave that for better bloggers than I am - looking at you, <a href="https://lizwillcock.com/" target="_blank">Liz Willcock</a>.) But I am on my way to figuring out what role wellness plays in my life - from yoga and meditation to meal prepping, self care and walks in the park. I'm glad we'll get to figure it out together.</p>
